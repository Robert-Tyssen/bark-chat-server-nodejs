# Barkchat Server Node.js
## About This project
This repository is still very much a work in progress and will be updated regularly. I'm working on this as a portfolio project to highlight my skills as a back-end developer
and learn some new tools and technologies throughout the development cycle.

This repository provides a simple Node.js server to expose API requests for core functionality such as authentication and messaging. It will take
inspiration from popular real-time chat apps such as WhatsApp or Discord.
